# My Personal Project

## Octopus Aquarium

For my term project, I will design a simple incremental game. An incremental game is one which the user plays by merely
clicking on several objects, perhaps to purchase items, move constructs, or upgrade gadgets, and then waiting in real
time to make progress. For simplicity, my game will only consist of an aquarium and some octopuses, and my target
audience will be casual gamers of any age.

I chose to design an incremental game because I want to become a game developer in the future. An incremental game is
the easiest one to design and one I reckon will provide a good learning experience. In this project, I hope to achieve
the following:
- let the user customize the aquarium to some degree
- implement a feeding system
- create a sense of progression to motivate gameplay activity
